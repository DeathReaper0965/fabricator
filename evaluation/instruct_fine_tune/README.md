# Evaluation of LLMs NLP Downstream Task capabilities through instruction-fine-tuning


## Settings

Evaluate the "downstream" capabilities through instructions.

1. Compare different existing LLMs on the same task.
2. Compare a baseline LLM with a fine-tuned LLM on the same task.
3. Compare a not-downstream fine-tuned LLM with a downstream fine-tuned LLM on the same task.
